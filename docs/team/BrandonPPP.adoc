== PROJECT: AlgoSenpai Adventures (ASA)
== Overview
AlgoSenpai Adventures is a desktop Personal Teaching Assistant
application. It has a GUI but most user interactions occur on CLI
(Command Line Interface). It is written in Java 11 by developers of
AY1920S1-T09-3. The application targets students taking classes in
data structures and algorithms. Students interested to reinforce their
understanding of data structures and algorithms will find this
application useful.


== Summary of contributions
* *Major enhancement*: Created functionality for users to review their
quizzes, mistakes, and progress.
** `print user <filename>.pdf`: Prints user's stats and learning progress.
** `print archive <filename>.pdf`: Prints archived questions.
** `print quiz <filename>.pdf`: Prints the last attempted quiz.
** `review <x>`: Reviews selected question in the last attempted quiz.
** `archive <x>`: Archives select question in the last attempted quiz.


** Justification: This feature differentiates the product from other
competitors' because a user can learn from their mistakes immediately
after taking a quiz and save a record of the questions attempted for
his/her revision.
** Highlights: This feature is the final integration and depends on the
implementation on other features.The implementation was challenging due to:
*** Integration with the quizzes. For instance,
`print quiz <filename>.pdf` depends on whether a quiz has been
attempted as no quiz is recorded when the program first launches.
*** Changes in the storage. For instance, `print user <filename>.pdf`
depends on how the user information is stored in text file.


* *Minor enhancement*: Created `history` command to view list of
queries entered by the user.
* *Minor enhancement*: Implemented the music feature to play music.
* *Minor enhancement*: Created `volumne <x>` command to adjust the
volume
* *Minor enhancement*: Created a Splash Screen that launches at the
start of the application
* *Minor enhancement*: Created the `quiz <chapter name>` command
to select the chapter for the quiz.

== FAQ

*Q*: Does my game auto-save for me or do I have to manually save it?  +
*A*: The game will try to save an instance for you automatically after certain checkpoints. However, in some unforeseen circumstances, the program might terminate midway, causing your progress to not be saved. As such, we recommend users to do a manual save occasionally as well.

*Q*: How do I maximise my learning potential with the report that I have generated?   +
*A*: The report generated will give a good indication on the chapters that you are weak at, based on the time taken to solve the questions, as well as the number of question you gotten correct. As such, more effort can be placed into practicing the chapters which are deemed “weak” by the reports as it indicates a lack of conceptual understanding.

*Q*: Is there a time limit to the questions given? +
*A*: There is no time limit for each question currently. Users are expected to improve with more practice and as such they should be able to answer questions within the stipulated time. Questions at the beginning are generally given more time than questions towards the ending of the chapter.

*Q*: I made an accidental mistake in my answer for the previous question. Is there a way for me to undo it? +
*A*: Yes. You can enter the command `back` to redo the last question.

*Q*: What is the difference between `undo` and `back`?  +
*A*:`undo` will reverse the decision made by the user while `back` simply returns to the previous question. `undo` will not reverse any answer input given by the user, but rather any other console commands given.

*Q*: How can I keep a copy of the questions?  +
*A*: You can either archive the questions in the game with the command `archive` or print the questions into PDF with the command `print`.

*Q*: Will the questions in each quiz be repeated?   +
*A*: Each question will be phrased the same; however, the list of numbers for the question are randomly generated.

*Q*: Can I challenge friends in a multiplayer mode?   +
*A*: Unfortunately, you can’t. However, you still can share your scores with your friends through email.

*Q*: Are there automatic software updates?    +
*A*: There is no automatic software updates. To get the updates, you need to redownload the latest version of the software.
